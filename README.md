- Python (>= 3.x)
- Git

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this project, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GilEtzioni/cummunication-project.git
cd cummunication-project
```

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is recommended to create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Installing Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Running the Project

Execute the main script to start the application:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check if the virtual environment is activated.
- Verify that Python is installed and correctly added to your system path.
